<p>The rapid introduction of new technologies has resulted in a shift of consumers' shopping behaviour. This has in turn resulted in a shift of the role of the traditional, brick-and-mortar store, transforming it from just a sales channel into one that makes up part of the customer experience. This also means that the role of retailer professionals have also shifted, from one that is focused on sales, into one that is focused on experiential marketing and customer satisfaction to ensure customer loyalty.</p>

<p>As the anchor provider for the retail sector, SIRS provides a full range of programmes catered to retail professionals at different stages of their careers - from the retail associate, to the retail manager - including <a href="/retail-programmes/WSQ-full-qualification-programmes/">WSQ Certification Programmes (Full Qualification)</a>, and <a href="/wsq-programmes/wsq-modular-programmes/">WSQ Certified Modular Programmes</a>. This ensures that retail professionals are kept updated on the relevant skillsets to delight customers in their entire shopping journey, increasing customer loyalty and business revenue.</p>

<p>The Singapore Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) is a national credential system that trains, develops, assesses and certifies skills and competencies for the Singapore workforce. WSQ offers bite-sized training modules, at the end of which, a Statement of Attainment (SOA) is awarded. Trainees can also accumulate relevant SOAs to achieve a WSQ full qualification. Given the importance of WSQ training in developing the skills and competencies of the Singapore workforce, this study investigates the benefits to individuals who participated in WSQ training by examining their wage and employability outcomes in the year after training.</p>

<p>As the anchor provider in the retail industry, SIRS offers a full suite of WSQ Certificate Programmes in modular and full-qualification basis, training retail employees from the rank-and-file, to the management, in the latest skillsets required to continually delight customers:</p>
