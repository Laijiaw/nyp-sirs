<p>The rapid introduction of new technologies has resulted in a shift of consumers' shopping behaviour. This has in turn resulted in a shift of the role of the traditional, brick-and-mortar store, transforming it from just a sales channel into one that makes up part of the customer experience. This also means that the role of retail professionals has also shifted, from one that is focused on sales, into one that is focused on experiential marketing and customer satisfaction to ensure customer loyalty.</p>

<p>As the anchor provider for the retail sector, SIRS provides a full suite of programmes including <a href="/wsq-programmes/wsq-full-qualification-programmes">WSQ Full Qualification Programmes</a> and <a href="wsq-programmes/wsq-modular-programmes">WSQ Certified Modular Programmes</a>, catered to retail professionals at different stages of their careers – from the retail associate, to the retail manager – in the latest skillsets required to continually delight today’s customers. </p>
