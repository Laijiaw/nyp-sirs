<p>According to Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, the best predictor of success in what you do is your mindset. You can either view every situation ‘glass half full’ or ‘glass half empty’. Mindset is the established set of attitudes held by someone, a belief that orients the way we handle situations - the way we sort out what is going on and what we should do. How well we handle customer often depends on the mindset.
