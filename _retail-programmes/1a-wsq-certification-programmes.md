<p>The Singapore Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) is a national credential system that trains, develops,assesses and certifies skills and competencies for the Singapore workforce. WSQ offers bite-sized training modules, at the end of which a Statement of Attainment (SOA) is awarded. Trainees can also accumulate relevant SOAs to achieve a WSQ full qualification. Given the importance of WSQ training in developing the skills and competencies of the Singapore workforce, this study investigates the benefits to individuals who participated in WSQ training by examining their wage and employability outcomes in the year after training.</p>
