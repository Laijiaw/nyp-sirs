  <li>Shifting the mindset of business owners and management to achieve successful business outcomes</li>
  <li>Understanding the required skillsets for businesses to remain competitive</li>
</ul>

<p>As the anchor provider in the retail industry, SIRS keeps Singapore retailers abreast through various programmes and events. This includes strategic partnerships with top global industry leaders such as Alibaba Business School in the development of high-level programmes. The Alibaba CEO Programme brings business owners and leaders on an immersive trip to Alibaba Business School to experience first-hand what the phenomenon of New Retail looks and feels like, and in the process, develop strategies in the transformation of their own businesses.</p>
