<p>We believe that there are two main components in successful transformation and upskilling of the workforce: education, and training.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>Education of our retail workforce entails the following:
  
  <ul>
  <li>Being informed of the latest global and local shifts and trendsin the retail industry</li>
  <li>Shifting the mindset of business owners and management to achieve successful business outcomes</li>
  <li>Understanding the required skillsets for businesses to remain competitive</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>As the anchor provider in the retail industry, SIRS keeps Singapore retailers abreast through various programmes and events. This includes strategic partnerships with top global industry leaders such as Alibaba Business School in the development of high-level programmes. The Alibaba CEO Programme brings businss owners and leaders on an immersive trip to Alibaba Business School to experience firsthand what the phenomenon of New Retail looks and feels like, and in the process, develop strategies in the transformation of their own businesses.</p>

<p>SIRS is also the organiser of the Industry Practitioner Seminar, its annual flagship event that brings together industry thought leaders and business owners to exchange ideas and network, while being updated of the latest trends in the retail sector. The annual IPS is also an avenue for SIRS to announce new initiatives to spearhead transformation in the retail sector. In 2019, SIRS was proud to announce its partnership with Singapore Media Academy in the launch of the first joint Professional Certificate in Digital Retail Entertainment.</p>

<h3>Training</h3>

<p>Aside from education, SIRS also provides a whole suite of training programmes to equip retailers in the latest skillsets both in offline and online retail. This includes the inculcation of service leadership through our <a href="/retail-programmes">retail programmes</a>, and digital marketing and commerce skills to enable businesses to grow their online revenue through our <a href="/digital-programmes">digital programmes</a>. For maximum effectiveness, SIRS programmes offer a combination of classroom lessons and hands-on sessions, allowing learners to put their learnings into practice.</p>
