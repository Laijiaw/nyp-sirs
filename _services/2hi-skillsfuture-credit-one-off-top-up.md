<h4>What is Advanced Usage of One-Off SkillsFuture Credit Top-Up (SFC2)?</h4>

<p>On 18 February 2020, the Government announced a one-off SkillsFuture Credit top-up of $500 for all Singaporeans aged 25 and above in 2020. The top-up will be effective from 1 October 2020.
Access to this SkillsFuture Credit top-up has been brought forward to 1 April 2020 to enable Singapore Citizens to pick up skills to boost their employability. This is in view of the current challenging economic conditions due to COVID-19.

<b>Step 3:</b> Upon receiving your application, SIRS will email the claim application form for your completion. Please return the completed form to SIRS by either email at <a href="mailto:courses@sirs.edu.sg">courses@sirs.edu.sg</a> or WhatsApp at 9223-2979. If you don’t have a scanner, you can send the form as a photo attachment. Please ensure the image is sharp and clear.
 
<i>Note: One claim application form per course. Example: if you register for 3 courses, you are to submit 3 claim application forms.</i>

<h4>How do I know my application is approved?</h4>
<p>SSG will inform both the applicant and SIRS via email on the outcome of the claim submission. Please write you submit a valid email address in the form.</p>

<p>If your course fee exceeds the available SFC2 balance, you can utilise the available SFC1 balance to pay for the remaining course fees – for this, SSG will submit a claim for SFC1 on your behalf.</p> 

<h4>I have registered for a course and indicated I wish to use my SFC2, but now I am unable to attend the class. What should I do?</h4>
<p>Please inform SIRS at <a href="mailto:courses@sirs.edu.sg">courses@sirs.edu.sg</a> at least one working day before the start of the course for any of the following situations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cancellation of course/s</li>
  <li>Postponement of course/s</li>
  <li>Not able to turn up for class</li>
  </ul>

<p>SIRS will inform SSG to cancel the required claim so that SSG can reinstate credit to your account.</p>
