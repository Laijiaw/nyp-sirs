<h4>What is Enhanced Training Support For SMEs (ETSS)?</h4>
<p>Skills upgrading remains a key mechanism for companies to raise productivity.  Compared to larger companies with more resources, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) 
are less able to send their employees for training.  
The Government has thus enhanced training support for SMEs by providing  higher course fee funding and increased absentee payroll cap.</p>

<b>Who is eligible for Enhanced Training Support for SMEs?</b>
<p>To be considered as a SME, please refer to the eligibility criteria 
<a href="http://www.ssg.gov.sg/programmes-and-initiatives/funding/enhanced-training-support-for-smes1.html">here.</a>

<b>Which programmes can I use it for?</b>
<p>The  enhanced  subsidies  will  apply  to SSG-supported certifiable courses. You can enjoy ETSS for all SIRS programmes, masterclasses and workshops.</p>

<b>How does it work</b>
<p>For all eligible SMEs, sponsored staff enjoys 90% fee subsidy for all approved programmes. The company enjoys higher absentee payroll at the usual 80% of basic hourly 
salary, at a higher capped of $7.50 per hour.</p>

<b>How do I apply?</b>
<p>Your company may apply through the <a href="https://www.skillsconnect.gov.sg/sop/portal/">SkillsConnect</a> for the programme you attended. The Government will reimburse the additional programme fee funding  along with the 
absentee payroll.</p>
