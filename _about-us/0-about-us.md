The Singapore Institute of Retail Studies (SIRS) is a Continuing Education & Training (CET) institute of Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP). Set up in 2006, SIRS’ excellent performance and track record won the conferment of the National CET Institute status, the pinnacle status for CET centres. In 2016, SIRS is appointed as the Anchor Provider for the Retail Industry by *SkillsFuture Singapore, as well as the Lean Enterprise Development Multiplier and Programme Manager for the Professional Conversion Programme & Earn And Learn Programme by Workforce Singapore.

On 30 November 2016, SIRS-NYP and UniSIM signed a collaboration agreement to offer a new articulation pathway for participants of the Retail SkillsFuture Earn & Learn Programme (ELP). ELP candidates, upon completion of their WSQ Specialist Diploma in Retail Management, can enrol in UniSIM’s Bachelor of Science in Marketing programme and gain recognition for up to 30 credit units, enabling them to complete the programme in a shorter period of time.

In addition to expanding our services for the evolving retail industry, SIRS-NYP also took on a collaboration with world digital leader, Alibaba Group's TaoBao University to offer a suite of cutting edge digital programmes to help our retailers adopt ecommerce and omni-channel strategies to succeed in today's digital context. Retailers will attain first-hand insights on successful e-commerce strategies, skills, implementation roadmaps and learn how to achieve indisputable market progress in the light of technology disruption.
