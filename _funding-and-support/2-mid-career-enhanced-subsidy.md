<h3>What is SkillsFuture Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy?</h3>

The SkillsFuture Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy supports and encourages lifelong learning and helps Singaporeans stay responsive to a changing workplace. Recognising that mid-career individuals may face greater challenges in undertaking training, the Government has implemented this programme to encourage mid-career Singaporeans to upskill and reskill. Eligible individuals will receive higher subsidies of up to 90% of course fees for SSG-supported courses.​

<h3>Am I eligible for Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy?</h3>

Only  Singapore  Citizens  aged  40  and  above  will  be  eligible  to  receive  the enhanced subsidies.

<h3>Which are the programmes can I use it for?</h3>

The  enhanced  subsidies  will  apply  to SSG-supported certifiable courses. You can enjoy Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy for all SIRS programmes, masterclasses and workshops.

<h3>How do I apply for the enhanced subsidy?</h3>

For self-sponsored individuals, you do not have to apply for the additional fee subsidy when you attend SIRS programmes. You will only need to pay the nett fee (full course fee after SSG’s grant).

For company-sponsored employees, your company will have to <a href="https://www.skillsconnect.gov.sg/" target="_blank">apply through the SkillsConnect portal</a> for the programme you attended. The Government will reimburse the additional programme fee funding along with the absentee payroll.
