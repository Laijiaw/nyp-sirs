<p>The Lean Enterprise Development (LED) Scheme helps enterprises in transforming and growing in the new manpower-lean landscape. It is a one-stop cross-agency government assistance and transitional manpower support platform that helps businesses transform and grow.</p>

<p>Through the LED Scheme, enterprises are enabled to tap into various assistance schemes to become more manpower-lean, while building a stronger Singaporean core and develop a better quality workforce.</p>

<p>SIRS is an appointed LED Multiplier, and we seek to help to accelerate the adoption of manpower-lean initiatives under the LED scheme. Contact us today for:
