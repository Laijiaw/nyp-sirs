<h4>What is the Entreprise Development Grant (EDG)?</h4>
<p>Today and into the future, companies that thrive are the ones that have strong business foundations and strategies, adopt technology and innovative processes, 
and grow their overseas presence.<br>
<br>
The Enterprise Development Grant (EDG) helps Singapore companies grow and transform. This grant supports projects that help you upgrade your business, innovate or 
venture overseas, under three pillars:
<ol>
<li>Core Capabilities</li>
Projects under Core Capabilities help businesses prepare for growth and transformation by strengthening their business foundations. These should go beyond basic 
functions such as sales and accounting.<br><br>

<li>Innovation and Productivity</li>
Projects under Innovation and Productivity support companies that explore new areas of growth, or look for ways to enhance efficiency. These could include reviewing 
and redesigning workflow and processes. Companies could also tap into automation and technologies to make routine tasks more efficient.<br><br>

<li>Market Access</li>
Projects under Market Access support Singapore companies that are willing and ready to venture overseas. You may tap into the EDG to help defray some of the costs of 
expanding into overseas markets.<br><br>
</ol>
