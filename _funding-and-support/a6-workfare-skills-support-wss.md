You will need to have a valid PayNow account tied to your NRIC number for TA to be disbursed to you.<br>

If you are employed, your employer will be making regular CPF contributions to your CPF account, and you are not required to apply for TA.<br>

Employability Institute (e2i) centres within 120 days after your course ends.<br>

In general, if all relevant information (i.e. CPF contributions for employee and supporting documents for self-employed) are in order and no further clarifications 
are needed from the trainee, the TA will be credited to the trainee’s PayNow registered bank account in approximately 1-3 months.<br>
