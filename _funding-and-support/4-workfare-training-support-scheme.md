<h3>What is Workfare Training Support (WTS) Scheme?</h3>

Workfare rewards work and encourages development by supplementing the incomes and retirement savings of older, lower-waged Singaporean workers. Workfare Training Support (WTS) is the training support pillar in Workfare scheme.

<h3>Am I eligible for WTS?</h3>

You will receive a letter for Workfare Income Support (WIS) & WTS, if you are eligible. For qualifying criteria to be a WTS recipient, please refer here.

<h3>What does the WTS comprise of?</h3>

As a WTS recipient, you enjoy a 95% fee subsidy for all approved programmes. Companies enjoy absentee payroll at the usual 80% of basic hourly salary, at a higher capped of $7.50 per hour.

<h3>Which are the programmes can I use it for?</h3>

The  subsidies  will  apply  to SSG-supported certifiable courses. You can enjoy WTS for all SIRS programmes, masterclasses and workshops.

<h3>How do I apply for WTS?</h3>

For self-sponsored individuals, you do not have to apply for the additional fee subsidy when you attend SIRS programmes. You will only need to pay the nett fee (full course fee after SSGâ€™s grant).

For company-sponsored employees, companies may <a href="https://www.skillsconnect.gov.sg/" target="_blank">apply through the SkillsConnect portal</a> for the programme you attended. The Government will reimburse the additional programme fee funding along with the absentee payroll.
