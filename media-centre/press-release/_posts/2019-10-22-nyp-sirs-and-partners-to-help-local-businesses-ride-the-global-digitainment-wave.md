<b>Singapore, 22 October 2019</b> – Nanyang Polytechnic’s Singapore Institute of Retail Studies (NYP-SIRS) and its valued partners, Alibaba-Taobao University and the Singapore Media Academy (SMA), will offer new programmes to support local companies in developing skillsets useful in leveraging the new Retail Digitainment industry. 

<p>Globally, the retail digitainment industry is valued at S$20 billion  today, with growing popularity of live streaming e-commerce platforms such as Lazada, Qoo10, and Shopee. Digitainment, a mashup of digital and entertainment, refers to the content created by live streamers that entertain and interact with their viewers even as they sell products. By modelling their products in an engaging manner while delivering interesting banter as well as addressing queries and comments, these live streamers have built a unique connection with their audience. The retail digitainment industry is most developed in China, while in Singapore, live streamers have also been building their following. To succeed in this industry, skills in big data analytics, product sales, marketing, live-broadcasting are required. 

<p>From November 2019, NYP-SIRS will offer a new Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) in new media to help businesses meet their talent needs by enabling mid-career Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs) to equip themselves with the relevant e-commerce and content management skills to take on emerging roles such as account managers and content producers in the retail industry. Under the PCP – New Media Professional programme, individuals will be able to make a switch into the retail sector, receive a stipend while retraining and be placed into jobs in retail companies. 

<p>“We brought in Alibaba, whose Taobao Live is synonymous with retail digitainment in China, for the edge needed to elevate Singapore’s retail digitainment industry to the next level. SMA’s speciality in developing compelling brand stories for new media complements NYP-SIRS’s expertise and industry understanding for a programme that is relevant and applicable to retailers here,’’ says Ms Megan Ong, Director of NYP-SIRS.

<p>“SMA draws on Mediacorp’s multiplatform content creation and storytelling expertise. We bring to this collaboration, important skills, techniques and a sense of creativity that new media professionals will need for creating content to support the digital transformation in retail,” says Ms Doreen Neo, Chief Content Officer, Mediacorp. SMA is a continuing education and training centre appointed by SkillsFuture Singapore.

<p>In addition, the training programme leading to the first Professional Certificate in Digital Retail Entertainment, jointly awarded by NYP-SIRS and SMA, is slated to commence in December 2019.  This programme will equip learners with the needed skillsets to create engaging New Media content. 

<p>The partnership between NYP-SIRS and SMA to transform the way Singapore retailers market their products was formalised at the Industry Practitioner Seminar (IPS) today with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding. The signing was witnessed by Guest-of-Honour Mr Chee Hong Tat, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Trade and Industry & Ministry of Education and Mr Ng Cher Pong, Chief Executive of SkillsFuture Singapore.

<p>Held annually, the IPS provides a platform for industry leaders to network and provide insights on new market trends and developments. Speakers at this year’s event include Mr Parminder Singh, Chief Commercial Officer of MediaCorp, Mr Zheng Lishun, Deputy General Manager of China Business Network and Ms Yvon Bock, Founder and CEO of Hegen Pte Ltd.
