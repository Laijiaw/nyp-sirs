<center>The MOU between Singapore Productivity Centre, Singapore Institute of Retail Studies and Heartland Enterprise Centre Singapore focuses on precinct-wide digitalisation projects in the heartlands </center>

<p>Today, Singapore Institute of Retail Studies (SIRS) and the Singapore Productivity Centre (SGPC) launched the Certified Digital & Productivity Consultant (CDPC) Programme. The Programme aims to upskill the digital and consultancy capability of current SGPC consultants and SIRS Digital Consultants for a start. The Heartland Enterprise Centre Singapore (HECS) will be CDPC’s first official partner.
 
<h3>More digital and productivity consultants for the heartlands</h3>

<p>To signify their collaboration for CDPC, SIRS, SGPC and HECS signed an MOU today, witnessed by Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry and Education, Mr Chee Hong Tat during his walkabout at the Ang Mo Kio town centre. SIRS and SGPC will partner HECS to train and upskill about 100 digital and productivity consultants and 20 trainers for the next two years. After completing the CDPC programme, these consultants would deepen their knowledge in digital commerce to support enterprises in setting up their online presence, selling effectively on local and overseas eMarketplaces, and analysing integrated online and offline consumer data. 

<p>The four-month programme comprises both classroom sessions and on-the-job training in selected retail companies and capability building projects. The CDPC consultants will provide training and consultancy for selected HECS initiatives for heartland enterprises. HECS will work with SIRS and SGPC to develop practical projects for the CDPC consultants to help heartland enterprises in digitalisation and productivity upgrades. 

<p>HECS will work closely with the pilot merchant associations and heartland enterprises to enable heartland enterprises to digitalise through various strategies including digital marketing, e-payment and e-commerce. This will depend on their business needs, readiness and stage of growth. This will be done as part of the rejuvenation efforts by HECS and merchant associations. 

<h3>Helping heartland enterprises in their digitalisation and productivity efforts </h3>

<p>With the change in consumer demographics, growing accessibility of precincts and growth in digital purchasing behaviour, every business needs to go digital in this age. Digitalisation is key to ensuring the competitiveness and growth of enterprises, including heartland enterprises. Beyond productivity, digitalisation is also a key focus of the Retail Industry Transformation Map to support retailers to digitise their business and extend their reach and grow their brands. Recognising that the needs of heartland enterprises are unique, the CDPC programme will provide relevant knowledge, guidance and consultants to support transformation effort of these enterprises. 

<p>“With the proliferation of heartland malls and chain retail brands in neighbourhoods, competition is intense for SMEs in the heartlands, especially the micro SMEs. There is an immediate need to hasten the digitalisation journey and improve productivity. The CDPC programme is developed with the aim of supporting these SMEs as they adopt digital solutions. The CDPC trained consultants can guide them in implementation, which is a much-needed resource to give them a leg up in this transformation effort,” said Ms Megan Ong, Director, Singapore Institute of Retail Studies, Nanyang Polytechnic. 

<p>The first run of the CDPC programme for 20 consultants will take place in July 2019. The training curriculum includes modules on productivity gap analysis, retail productivity for digital productivity for digital transformation, digital marketing, managing cross-border e-Commerce platforms and cyber security. HECS will marry the common needs of the heartland enterprises on the ground and the competence of the CDPC consultants through targeted projects that will transform the businesses.
