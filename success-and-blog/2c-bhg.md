<p>We started discussions with the SIRS team back in 2019. SIRS provided holistic advice and guidance to us on the various government grants & subsidies available, and this 
helped BHG defray costs and get substantial support which is vital in the success of the reinvention plan. In terms of development and grooming of staff, SIRS has been a 
great partner of BHG. We successfully concluded the first phase of training by June 2020 as planned despite multiple challenges posted by the pandemic. SIRS conducted a 
series of e-learning courses for BHG staff, helping our team learn about New Retail, and understand the current retail landscape of online merge offline. These training 
aligned BHG staff with the company’s new directions, helping the team adjust their mindset, away from traditional departmental stores. Our team also acquired new skills 
on how to engage customers in the new customer’s journey.  SIRS will continue to be the key partner of BHG in the subsequent phases of our three-year reinvention plan.</p>
