<p>Before attending Alibaba Business School - SIRS CEO Programme, I have no idea that e-commerce or social media marketing can create such a big influence in shaping 
my business evolution. The programme had completely changed my perspective on doing business in digital commerce. The subject-matter is timely, relevant, present, and 
important. After the trip, Fullhouse invested more resources on the e-commerce platforms and witnessed the sales revenue take a quantum leap from 9 million in 8 months 
to 7 million in 3 months. This was one of the best study trips I have ever attended. The training was very inspirational, energising, brought lots of ideas, with both 
substantial and in-depth knowledge together with case studies and learning from experience. The other participants were amazing, and I learned a lot from their experience 
and insights. I will send my digital team for the upcoming Alibaba programmes.</p>
