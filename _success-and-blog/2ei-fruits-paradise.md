<h4>Fruit Paradise applied lessons learnt from e-Commerce courses to its business during the pandemic</h4>

<p>The pandemic is forcing many businesses to pivot & find new ways to engage & sell to their customers online. Fruits Paradise, a family-owned business 
with over 40 years of experience selling high quality, in-season fruits is a perfect example of how a local business has remained resilient & adapted 
to disruptions in the industry brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Shen Jiangwen, the 56-year old owner of Fruit Paradise located in Ghim Moh Market was inspired by the New Retail concepts they were exposed to while 
attending <a href="/digital-programmes/alibaba-business-school/alibaba-ceo-programme">SIRS-Alibaba CEO Programme</a>, a study trip to Hangzhou, the owners experimented with new ways to sell online since then & have continued their
learning journey by enrolling for three more digital courses with SIRS. Mr Shen also shared their plans to launch their own brand logo, improve their 
packaging and be more active on Facebook to engage customers through livestreaming.</p>
