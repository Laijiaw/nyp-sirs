<p>Learn to adopt new retail tech solutions to help your business stand out from the competition. We are happy that our Digital Mentorship Programme (DMP) has helped another retailer incorporate tech to reach out and engage with more customers. Ms Nita, founder of VINCiTORE Shoes shared with Ch8 News her experience in adopting technology such as geofencing to bring people to her store.</p>

<p>In the interview, SIRS’ Business Development Manager, Celeste Tan, highlighted the importance for physical retailers to find ways to provide an integrated retail experience to attract customers while facing competition from e-Commerce. ‘The Art and Science of Visual Merchandising’ course has also helped more than 150 retailers to date, to strengthen their stores’ visual merchandising and adopt new technologies showcased at SIRS.</p>
