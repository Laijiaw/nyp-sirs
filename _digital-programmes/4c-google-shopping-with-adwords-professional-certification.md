Advertising in Google enables you to expand our online presence. According to StatCounter Global Stats in Jun 2018 report, Google holds almost 90% of search engine market share. Google Shopping, together with the use of AdWords, enables potential customers to see your product image, title, price, store name, and more. These ads give users a strong sense of the product you are selling before they click the ad, which gives you more qualified leads.
