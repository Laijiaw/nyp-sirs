<p>How customers shop is changing dramatically. It used to be a linear process – from awareness through
consideration to purchase. Now, in a connected marketplace, it is much more complex, with multiple and
overlapping touchpoints along the path to purchase.</p>

<p>Customers’ loyalties are shifting away from brands. Instead, they are seeking solutions at the ‘micromoments’ where 
decisions are made along their purchase journeys. From now on, companies that stand
out will be the ones that can provide these solutions – seamlessly and intuitively.</p>
