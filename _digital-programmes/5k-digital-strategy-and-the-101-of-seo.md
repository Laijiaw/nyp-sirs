<h4>Trainer Profile</h4>
<p><b>Jayden Ooi</b><br>
  <em>Entrepreneur, Digital Strategist</em><br>
Jayden is the founding partner of 2 service companies, Ambient (Software Develop-ment) and NightOwl (SEO), which he started in 2014. Prior to it, Jayden graduated from NUS School Of Computing, with a major in eCommerce in 2013. He started a tech startup during his stint in university, and won the prestigious Startup@Singapore competition. Unfortunately, the startup failed in late 2014. Through a chance encoun-ter, Jayden received an opportunity to use his breadth of knowledge to strategise the online business for a small F&B business. He eventually assisted them to overcome their digital obstacles and rise to the very top of their industry in 3 years with a 7 digits yearly turnover today. It was a pivotal moment, where Jayden transformed his failed startup into a competent in-house team of SEO-ninjas and software engineers in Sin-gapore & Malaysia, that create quality solutions to solve real digital problems. Jayden & team has successfully nailed a Rank 1 / Top 3 / Top 5 ranking in Google Page 1 that has successfully driven an exponential increase in business opportunities and break-through in yearly revenue growth for his clients.</p>
