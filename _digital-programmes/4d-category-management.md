Category management is a critical function to determine the success of an overall business strategy, and
this is especially true in the rapidly transforming retail space. As more consumers move between offline
and online platforms, category management helps facilitate consumer experience by optimising store
layouts and increasing the appeal of visual display. With proper clustering and centralising management
system in place, retailers can efficiently anticipate consumers’ needs, buy more effectively and save
significant sums of money in procurement.

build a sustainable business planning framework. Acquire practical techniques to understand consumers’
purchase decision process, learn to leverage data and assess performance, plan assortment, manage store
layouts and displays, identify growth opportunities, develop effective strategies and tactics to maximise
