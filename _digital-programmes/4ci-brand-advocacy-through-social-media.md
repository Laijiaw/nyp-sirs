<p>The power of social media has shaped our world into a highly connected one, changing the way people
work, socialize and shop. By leveraging on this connectivity, your organization is able to further expand
your reach by empowering employees, loyal customers, and partners as your brand advocates, to spread
a positive word-of-mouth recommendation across their social media channels.</p>

<p>It is therefore important to identify the group of fans from your existing constituents, who can help to
speak on your brandâ€™s behalf to create awareness, influence opinions, and purchase decisions. Brand
advocacy through social media is able to enhance the credibility of your brand, and bring you more
referrals and business opportunities.</p>
