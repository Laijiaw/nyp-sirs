Customers are everything for all businesses. For this reason, it is important for any businesses to
continuously be in touch with their customers. This is especially true when we are living in a digitally
connected era, where our customers can easily be engaged by your competitors.

Engagement involves establishing higher value customer relationships and deepening the relationship
with your current customers. The ultimate goal of customer engagement is to encourage your customers
to spend more time with your brand while establishing a stronger connection. In exchange, engaged
customers tend to spend more money and be more loyal.

This workshop is designed to equip individuals to generate ideas and opportunities to engage customers
in the digital world.
