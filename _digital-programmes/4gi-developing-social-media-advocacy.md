Leads through social media advocates convert more often than any other leads. Information shared
by advocates is deemed to be more credible than any content shared through the brand’s own social
channels. Organic social media marketing can help business gain visibility across social networks more
quickly and provide more engagement. This is the power of social media advocacy.

Developing Social Media Advocacy masterclass will demonstrate how you can develop a strategy to
engage your advocates to help you elevate and amplify your brand messaging to their own social networks.
