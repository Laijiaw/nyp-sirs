<img src="images/pcp/sirs-wsg-banner.jpg" style="text-align:center;width:50%;">

<p>As part of the Adapt and Grow Initiative, Workforce Singapore (WSG) and SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) jointly developed the Professional Conversion 
Programme (PCP) to help Professionals, Managers, Executives, and Technicians (PMETs) mid-career switchers undergo skills conversion to gain relevant 
competencies and take on new, exciting careers in different industries.

Singapore Institute of Retail Studies (SIRS) is the appointed programme manager for PCP in the retail sector, assisting and supporting employers 
with manpower challenges in the face of the ever-changing retail landscape. Through structured classroom and on-the-job training (OJT), retailers 
are better able to align their training according to their specific business needs.

SIRS offers a range of Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) for the Retail Professional, Digital Professional and New Media Professional, to 
equip Professionals, Managers, Executives, and Technicians (PMETs) transiting into these new careers with the right skillsets and support employers 
to attract talents for enterprise capability building.</p>
