Facebook is a popular social media platform for many businesses to market their brand and services.
Facebook Pages provide the most ideal business marketing solution as they are user-searchable and
public accessible by search engines. While some companies use Facebook Pages, many fail to fully benefit
from all that Facebook offers.

This masterclass will cover the structure of an effective Facebook Page, best practices and tips for using
Facebook Pages. Through hands-on practical session, participants will get to learn and apply their
knowledge in real-time. The class is suitable for retailers who already have a Facebook Page and want to
learn how to maximise it effectively.

Suitable for Marketing, Marcom & PR, Editorial, and Digital Marketing Teams.
