<p>According to Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, the best predictor of success in what you do is your
mindset. You can either view every situation ‘glass half full’ or ‘glass half empty’. Mindset is the established
set of attitudes held by someone, a belief that orients the way we handle situations - the way we sort out
what is going on and what we should do. How well we handle customer often depends on the mindset.</p>

<p>Learning through play boost positive emotions that activate the learning centres in the brain. Using LEGO
brixPLAY methodology, participants will discover and share new points of view and learn a better way to
think and behave. With the new skills and mindset acquired, they will be able to offer customers quality
