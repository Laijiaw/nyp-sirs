<p>While most small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are keenly aware of the need to go online, many lack the expertise to do so. Even after attending training, some SME retailers are unable to put their learning into practical actions or create sustainable work plans to achieve their business objectives.</p>

<p>Recognising that SMEs require personalised guidance to embark on their digital commerce journey, SIRS is proud to introduce the Digital Mentorship Programme (DMP), a first of its kind where a mentor will be assigned to work alongside the company to help them go digital.</p>

<p>The programmes under DMP feature 56 hours guided practicum and 16 hours of classroom training. A personal mentor will be attached to the trainee for three months, working closely together to create a customised action plan for the trainee's company to obtain digital readiness and elevate their online presence.</p>
