A good story is always more persuasive than facts. It is able to attract attention, engage emotions and
influence decisions. For businesses, a good story will help to make selling much easier. Customers today
are bombarded with more advertisements and messages than ever before, so a good story that resonates
with them can draw the attention of your audience, encourage interest and develop an emotional bond
between your customers and your brand.

Leveraging the power of storytelling is a way of conveying your brandâ€™s personality and offering without
being overly promotional, which can go a long way towards building your business. More and more
companies are recognising the impact of writing a good story and creating buzz for their brands. The
more the buzz, the more the awareness. The greater awareness, the higher the probability of being in the
top-of-mind position of your customers when they make purchasing decisions.
