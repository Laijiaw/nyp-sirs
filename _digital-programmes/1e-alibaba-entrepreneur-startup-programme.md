<h4>Testimonials</h4>
<p><em>"I feel that the Alibaba is very advanced in terms of e-commerce and digital marketing. The lecturers were all of a very high standard, both in terms of intellectual ability, practical knowledge, and even business sense. I was quite amazed that  the criteria is that they must have managed real business sites well before they are allowed to be lecturers."</em> - <b>Lucy Yow, New Asia Ferrell</b></p>
